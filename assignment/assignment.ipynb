        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?   \n",
        "\n",
        "  Wickham is focused on thinking more abstractly on the process of data cleaning, which most likely doesn't achive as much attention as it probably should. Removing NA's is an awesome thing, but beyond that, what should data look like in order to decide you're done cleaning? He introduces a criteria (each row is an observation, each column is a variable, each type of observational unit is a table) and explores the consequences\n",

        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?   \n",
        "     \n",
        "  Although data cleaning takes up a significant portion of data analysis, both in terms of time and mental effort, it remains an underexplored skill or task. The \"tidy data standard\" aims to streamline data cleaning by providing a consistent framework. This standard is designed to simplify the cleaning process by ensuring that everyone involved understands the goal and the typical steps needed to achieve it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"  \n",
        "    \n",
        "  The first sentence highlights how messy, disorganized data tends to introduce unique or unexpected challenges, whereas clean data tends to be more uniform. You’ve likely encountered this before: the data's creator structured it for their own purposes or convenience, and reshaping it effectively in R can take a lot of work. This is a nod to a joke from Russian literature. The second sentence points out that while the concept of a \"data frame/matrix\" is straightforward — rows as observations, columns as variables — it’s often a choice that benefits the analyst if made thoughtfully. For instance, if you have county-level data by year, what exactly *is* your data? An observation is a county-year, a fact that may not be obvious to someone unfamiliar with this type of data, leading them to mistakenly treat a county as the observation and, in turn, make poor decisions when cleaning and structuring the data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?  \n",
        "    \n",
        "  A dataset consists of a set of values, which can be either numeric or categorical/strings. Each value is associated with both a variable and an observation. A variable represents a group of values that assess the same characteristic or property (e.g., height, color, temperature, make/model). An observation is a group of values that describe it.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?  \n",
        "    \n",
        "  In tidy data, each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. If data isn't tidy, it's messy.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?  \n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Column headers represent values (such as years) rather than variable names. For example, unemployment by county over time is shown as a matrix where the columns represent years and the rows represent counties. The column header is a numeric value, like 2012, rather than a variable name like \"Year.\" 2. Multiple variables are combined into a single column. For instance, month-day-year dates encompass three elements: month, day, and year. Time variables typically need to be transformed into another format, such as normalized to a \"day 0\" and measured by the number of days since then. 3. Variables can be stored in both rows and columns. 4. Different types of observational units are stored in the same table. For example, entrepreneurs/firms, children/parents, and workers/firms are all included in one large file instead of separate datasets for each group. 5. A single observational unit is split across multiple tables, leading to data being duplicated in a cumbersome way that requires further cleaning and simplification. In Table 4, the columns are actually values of a \"hidden\" variable, which is income. Since income is a variable, you need to create a new column for income, alongside religion and frequency, as shown in Table 6. Now, the columns represent variable names rather than the values those variables take. \"Melting\" a dataset refers to this process of converting column-value variables into rows.\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 presents days as values across the top. In Table 12, those days are reshaped into a single variable, date. However, this still isn't considered tidy, as the element variable holds variable names instead of values — tmax and tmin represent measurements for the same day, meaning they are variable names, not values. In contrast, Table 12(b) is tidy since all entries represent attributes rather than variable names.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?    \n",
        "    \n",
        "  Wickham seeks a broader philosophy of data cleaning. If the tidy framework is merely about supporting specific tools, it becomes mere marketing. He envisions the tidy concept as more than just training people to use ggplot2 efficiently; it aims to establish a larger and more resilient ecosystem of ideas and tools for data science as a whole.\n",

One reason is economic: They shape how we measure need, allocate aid, and design policies that are implemented. Another reason is sociological: Understanding the actual proportions of different demographic groups is key to understanding who we are as a society, which can promote tolerance and inclusion. Certain areas of the country may be more homogeneous, but being able to objectively describe the nation’s true diversity is essential for shaping policy and helping citizens grasp the complexity of the needs and identities of others.

In older versions of the census, they asked questions like, \"Which group do you most identify with?\" but it’s unclear if that approach was effective for gathering data. Researchers likely used that variable and disregarded the rest of the nuanced information collected.\n",

        "> For SOGI, the HPS question is likely better suited for 2023. The \"assigned at birth\" question could feel somewhat intrusive, especially since it doesn’t give the option for respondents to select \"I don’t know\" or \"I prefer not to answer,\" which is problematic as it forces the enumerator to choose something. However, the question follows up with a more detailed set of categories that reflect current conversations on sex and gender. While the HPS version isn’t flawless, the ACS/Census version lacks any nuance or measurement on this topic. Additionally, the ACS/Census doesn’t collect data on sexuality, while HPS at least attempts to gather information on LGB and S identities.\n",
        "\n",
        "> I’ve encountered many race questions that only allow one selection and offer limited categories like \"White, Black, Asian, Other,\" which lack depth. The \"check all that apply\" approach, with broad categories and supplementary details, feels like a significant improvement. Similarly, many surveys provide limited or no options for SOGI data, so more detailed data collection like that of HPS (which is not perfect but is a genuine attempt) will be crucial moving forward. For example, some surveys suggest that 16-20% of people under 25 identify as LGBT, even though historically that number has been around 5-7%."

        "> The biggest issue, in my view, is that we often require individuals to fit themselves into a \"pie chart\" of identity without clearly explaining the purpose of the exercise. Take race as an example. The question \"What is your race?\" could be interpreted as \"Roughly, what percentage of your great-grandparents belonged to the following groups: White, Black, Asian, Indigenous?\" For instance, I am at least to my current knowledge 100% West African, coming from Ghana. This approach reflects an old idea of Americans as descendants of specific immigrant groups, but that’s not necessarily how people think of themselves or their culture today. Additionally, those great-grandparents would have had diverse, multi-layered identities. Someone can fully belong to multiple racial communities, so it makes more sense to ask, \"Which of the following groups do you identify with?\", as the Census has begun to do. Similarly, for SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) questions, it’s better to allow people to choose affiliation with different categories, rather than force them into a simplistic, one-dimensional response.\n",
        "\n",
        "> To formalize this a bit, think of it as choosing between category A and category B. You could model this as a dummy variable, `D`, where `D=0` means group A and `D=1` means group B. This forces a choice between A or B, but not both, and not neither. A \"select only one\" question with multiple categories results in a categorical variable where you're either in A, B, or nothing. A \"select all that apply\" question, like the race question on the Census, gives you a vector of categories, allowing any combination of ones and zeros, such as `AB`, `A`, `B`, or neither. In some cases, you might even want to go further and capture a numeric value representing how strongly someone associates with each category, like `(A=.75, B=.8)`, where the sum can exceed 1. But I doubt surveys actually attempt this, as it's difficult to consistently gather meaningful numeric responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "> When race/sex/gender categories have missing responses, people may be tempted to impute values. However, those who skip these questions likely do so for a reason, and imputing values based on available data is irresponsible. People who don’t respond are systematically different from those who do. For instance, if someone has complex ideas about their identity and chooses not to answer, imputing a value based on other demographic data is not just wrong—it undermines their choice to withhold an answer. This must be taken into account when handling self-reported data.\n",
        "\n",
        "> My concern when identity data is cleaned is that it gets oversimplified into just the \"main\" categories, stripping away nuance. For example, collapsing all Asian identities (Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, etc.) into one broad category erases the specific details the survey aimed to capture. A lot of effort goes into collecting nuanced data, but that nuance often disappears when it’s simplified for modeling purposes."

        "Violation of Privacy: Imputing sensitive characteristics, even with good intentions, risks infringing on an individual's right to privacy. These characteristics are often self-identified, and assuming or predicting them can be invasive.\n",
        "Consent and Autonomy: Automatically assigning protected characteristics removes an individual's autonomy over how they define themselves. People should have control over how they are represented, especially when it comes to complex and personal aspects of identity.\n",
        "Misrepresentation: Misclassifying someone’s race, gender, sex, or sexuality can cause harm, especially in environments where this information affects decisions about resource allocation, opportunities, or representation.\n",
        "Stereotyping and Bias Amplification: The imputation algorithm may reinforce harmful stereotypes or reflect societal biases. For instance, if the algorithm is trained on biased data, it might perpetuate stereotypes by associating certain characteristics with professions, neighborhoods, or behaviors.\n",
        "Dehumanization: Reducing complex, multifaceted identities to algorithmic predictions risks treating people as data points rather than individuals with unique lived experiences.\n",
        "2. Accuracy and Validity\n",
        "Imputation Errors: Algorithms can make errors in predicting these characteristics, which can be harmful, especially when incorrect information is used in sensitive contexts like hiring, housing, or medical care. Inaccurate imputations could disproportionately affect marginalized groups.\n",
        "Reductionism: Race, gender, sex, and sexuality are not fixed or universally defined. Many of these characteristics are fluid and context-dependent, making them particularly difficult to model accurately. Trying to quantify them may result in oversimplification of people's identities.\n",
        "Lack of Ground Truth: Unlike imputing missing values for objective variables (like income or age), protected characteristics often lack a clear ground truth because they are self-reported and socially constructed. This makes it challenging to determine whether an imputation is \"correct\" or ethical.\n",
        "3. Legal and Regulatory Concerns\n",
        "Discrimination and Legal Violations: Imputing characteristics like race or gender could lead to unintended discrimination, potentially violating anti-discrimination laws like the U.S. Civil Rights Act, GDPR in Europe, or similar legislation. Using imputed data in decision-making processes could exacerbate existing inequalities.\n",
        "Impact on Fairness Audits: Organizations that audit their systems for fairness and bias might find imputed characteristics problematic. How do you assess fairness when you're not working with real, self-identified data but rather algorithmically assigned characteristics?\n",
        "Potential for Abuse: There is a risk that such algorithms could be used for discriminatory purposes. Employers, insurers, or governments could misuse these imputations to engage in profiling or discriminatory practices, either consciously or unconsciously.\n",
        "4. Social and Cultural Sensitivity\n",
        "Complexity of Identity: Race, gender, and sexuality are complex, intersectional identities that evolve over time and across contexts. A purely data-driven approach might fail to capture the nuances of lived experiences, leading to a flattened or inaccurate portrayal of individuals.\n",
        "Historical Trauma and Power Dynamics: The classification of people by race, gender, or sexuality has historically been used to justify exclusion, discrimination, and violence. Using algorithms to impute these characteristics could trigger historical wounds and reinforce oppressive structures.\n",
        "Cultural Differences: The meaning of these characteristics varies across societies. For example, race in the U.S. is viewed differently than race in Brazil or South Africa. Applying a one-size-fits-all algorithm could result in erroneous and harmful generalizations.\n",
        "5. Trust and Transparency\n",
        "Erosion of Trust: If people become aware that their sensitive characteristics are being inferred without their consent, it could lead to a loss of trust in institutions and systems that use such data. This could cause people to avoid participation in systems where their data is used, leading to further marginalization.\n",
        "Black-Box Algorithms: If the algorithm is opaque, it becomes difficult to scrutinize how these imputations are made. Transparency is critical for ensuring accountability, but many machine learning models, especially those based on deep learning, are often black boxes, making it hard to explain or justify the results.\n",
        "6. Moral Implications\n",
        "Devaluing Self-Identification: Imputing characteristics may devalue the importance of self-identification. Identity is a personal, lived experience, and taking that agency away from individuals could be deeply problematic. If organizations rely on algorithms rather than allowing people to define themselves, it might undermine the value of individual identity.\n",
        "Potential for Forced Categorization: In some cases, people may not want to define themselves by categories like race, gender, or sexuality. Imputing these categories could force individuals into boxes that they reject or don’t identify with.\n",
        "Recommendations for Avoiding Harm\n",
        "Respect for Consent: Always give individuals the choice to provide or withhold this sensitive information. Imputation should only be used when it is absolutely necessary and with full transparency.\n",
        "Limit Imputation Scope: If imputing these values is unavoidable (for example, for legal compliance or fairness audits), limit its scope to aggregate, anonymized data rather than assigning characteristics to individuals.\n",
        "Ethical Frameworks: Develop robust ethical frameworks and conduct impact assessments to understand the risks of misusing imputed characteristics.\n",
        "Bias Audits and Fairness: Regularly audit the algorithm for biases and ensure that it does not reinforce systemic discrimination. Ensure diverse voices are included in developing the system.\n",
        "Transparency: Clearly explain how the algorithm works, what data it uses, and how imputed characteristics might be applied, ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to correct or dispute imputed data."
